Nowadays more and more people find themselves in all kinds of dangerous situations. We decided to cover some of the most dangerous ones, such as earthquakes and bomb shelling. Our goal is to provide rescuers with a powerful tool, allowing them to conduct safer and more efficient operations in disaster zones. We are planning on creating a program, the purpose of which is to categorize destruction levels, estimate the survival chance of victims and help plan better rescue missions.
